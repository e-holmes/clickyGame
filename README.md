## What can clickyGame do?
#### This app allows you to test your memory with a fun game. Everytime you click an image you haven't clicked before your score goes up by one and the photos change position. Click a photo you have already clicked and the score resets and the photos change position. Your high score will be updated each time you beat your high score.
